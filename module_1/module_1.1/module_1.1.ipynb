By the end of this course, you should feel confident to write simple Python programs for a variety of purposes and understand more complex Python programs written by others.\n",

The *short answer* is that Python is a great practical skill if you want to work with data to answer linguistic questions (corpus linguistics) or build models that can analyse, process and generate text (NLP). Learning programming also helps you develop problem solving skills which are very transferable.\n",

We believe that part of the training to become a great Computational Linguist should be to become confident in applying NLP methods to gain real insights from real corpus data. Our aim in this these Python labs ('PyCompLing') is to give you a gentle introduction to Python 3 programming that is *custom-made* for Computational Linguists. If your interest at the moment is more on the theory (we hope you'll soon get hooked on programming!) then you can think that the skills you learn in the Python classes will provide a functional context for the concepts you are studying in the lectures. And if you wish to pursue the subject further then the skills you learn here should equip you for more advanced study, e.g. in a 3rd year project or in MPhil research.  \n",

        "* Python 3 is one of the most widely taught programming languages at universities. But why the popularity? Essentially Python is fairly easy to learn and comes with a powerful set of libraries that allow you to quickly get up and running with your own NLP tasks and applications. Or in other words you can draw on a wide body of pre-built programs that others have already built so you don't have to re-invent the wheel! \n",

In order to go ahead with the Python course we will therefore need to ask you to **please bring along your own laptops** to the lab sessions. The lecture room we have reserved has power points available at each seat so you should be able to work from mains power for the duration of the lab. All rooms have access to the University's WiFi network - please make sure before each lab that you can connect as all work will be online. For those of you without laptops, the MMLL library has three Chromebooks to lend out. If you need a Chromebook for the lab, please reserve one as early as possible. Please note that you will not find it practical to work from handheld devices - you will need a reasonable sized screen and keyboard to type."

However don't worry if you can't complete the work within the lab time, SAQs can be completed away from the lab, e.g. on a Chromebook in the MMLL library. SAQs are checked in person at a sign-up session by Teaching Assistants (TAs) in Week 7 of Michaelmas and Lent terms. At the sign-up session TAs will choose some parts of the SAQs and ask you to explain your answers. The grading session is for the examiners to guard against plagiarism. **Do not search for or view solutions to the SAQs on the Web or share SAQ solutions with your friends**. SAQs should be your own work and Teaching Assistants will be looking to make sure that you understand your own answers. At the sign-up session you should have your notebooks ready and open in a browser, and your code should execute without errors.
